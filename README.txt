This is a simple app that shows how to connect an iOS app to Yahoo Local Search API, which is a REST-based API.  

User can input a keyword such as 'sushi' and the app will find all sushi listing nearby sushi restaurant.

This app shows how to implement CLLocationManagerDelegate, UISearchBarDelegate, MKMapViewDelegate, and adopt MKAnnotation protocol.
